# Basics

## Grid
Computer screens are made of a sequence of squares called pixels just like the squares you see in those old retro games or the squares in Minecraft.

Computer graphics are magnificent; From squares to circles and curves, Every single graphic in computer is made of some tiny little dots.

Arendelle is part of the team too but with a huge difference: Arendelle is made of pixels with dynamic sizes. By default the size of Arendelle pixels are 10 times bigger than a normal pixel but no worry! You can change their size anytime!

As Arendelle is a special environment and has it's own rules and culture we call these squares 'dots' and the screen 'grid'.

## The most basic commands
In Arendelle there is something like a computer mouse called pointer. To understand what is the pointer Arendelle grid as a chess board so pointer will be one of those chessmen. To color a dot we need to select it and to select a dot we need to move the pointer on it then paint where the pointer is.<br>

To move the pointer and paint we'll need 5 commands. Something fun about Arendelle commands is they are only one character! The first 5 commands we are going to learn are:
<br><br>

|Command    | What it does          |
|-----------|-----------------------|
|`R`        | Go to the left        |
|`L`        | Go to the right       |
|`D`        | Go down               |
|`U`        | Go up                 |
|`P`        | Paint the current dot |

#### Example
There is no way to learn programming without programming! To understand the commands you have to code a bit! But don't you worry!

```
PRD PRD P
```

#### Exercise
For developers there are an infinity number of possible exercises. The best way to become a better developer is coding, Still it is 75-80 percent of job and the rest of the story is about many techniques and one of them is reading codes and figuring out what happens when you run the code. So let's begin with this one

```
RPR DP DP LP LP
```

**NOTE** : The shape you have created is called [Glider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_%28Conway%27s_Life%29) from the [Conway's Game Of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The first proved to be awesome cellular automaton witch is accepted by the most Hackers to be their logo.

## Colors
We use `N` command. And please notice that if you're using the last color (the 4th opacity)
Arendelle comes with four colors so you can fill each dot with a different color as you see here:

Our default color is the full opacity one, to move to the next color we use `N` command. And please notice that if you're using the last color (the 4th opacity) by using the `n` command you'll move to the first color (the first opacity). So lets have look at a few examples:


<hr>
<h4>Example</h4>

```
P RN P RN P RN P RN P
```

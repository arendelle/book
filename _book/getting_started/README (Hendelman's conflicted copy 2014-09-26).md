# How does a language works?
Welcome to the world of programming with Arendelle! To write your very first Arendelle code we need a software called "Interpreter". To understand Interpreter we need to know what a 'code' is?

Computer is made of many parts but there is this one part called CPU (For Central Processing Unit) that is computer's brain. It reads codes and evaluates* them.

This codes that CPUs run is called 'Machine Code'. Machine code is a code in 'Binary' means numbers made of zero and one. This codes are fully numbers and they are not readable to humans.

At first developers could understand this codes but as soon as programs became more complex they became hard to read that's why developers created programming languages. This languages are readable to humans and they make programming like dancing in heaven! However CPUs are stupid untalented people! They won't try to learn human languages and they kept using their own 'machine code'.

Every relationship needs some sacrifices so developers accepted this fact and they developed a software called "Compiler". Compilers are some language experts who speak both human language and machine language. So they read human language and generate machine language.

Each language comes with a compiler. There is also another kind of languages called 'Interpreted'. In this languages there is no compiler but there is an 'Interpreter'. Interpreters are also clever. They speak human code but they are smart as they do know how that code works and well they do the code themselves! As you see they are very hard working!

Arendelle is one of those Interpreted friends. But it's only a language core.

To use Arendelle you must use an Arendelle Environment. Arendelle environments are programs that you can use to run Arendelle codes with. In the next section you will learn about some Arendelle environments and how to install them.

* Evaluating : Developers call the process of running a code "Evaluating"

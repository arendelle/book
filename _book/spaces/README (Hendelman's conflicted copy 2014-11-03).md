# Spaces
Spaces are somehow the most important part of programming. In some languages like Assembly you will understand this however their actual name outside Arendelle is not spaces, Their name is “Variables” but as I hate that name we have this much more pretty name “Space”

## Why we call them space? What are they anyway?
Well think of when someone asks : What is the 2 + 3 ?.<br>

Well, while the answer is obvious, the path you take to get into that answer has some points to think about how this thing actually happens in your mind?<br>

In your mind, you create a memory box called “the first number” and then another box with the name “the second number”. Now you put 2 in your first box and then 3 in your second box of memory.<br>

Now your mind creates a new memory box called “Result” and then it reads the 2 and 3 from those boxes, calculates the sum of them and then it creates the 5 and stores the 5 into the result box.<br>

This is the way that our minds memory works. And as the computer systems are based on our minds they have memory too! We can store data and well this is the definition of a computer: ***A device that does an operation based on instructions by the user on some data*** in this section we will learn how to work with datas.

## Computer memories
- A space is a memory space in your computer’s temporary data storage called a ***RAM***, Just like the way our mind has two separated memories our computers got them two, This two memory systems are “Temporary Memory” and “Long-time Memory”. What are those? Well, the temporary memory is a small memory which is too fast so when your system is thinking it uses that memory. This memory erases each time you shutdown your system, The name of your computer’s temporary memory is RAM, There is also another memory which stores you large amount of data as long as you want and those data stays there till you manually delete them. This memory is much slower than RAM but it can keep large data and those data remains there while your system is turned down. There are many different kinds of this memories but Hard Disk Drives and SSD ( flash drives ) are both long memories<br>

Till today you have used the long time memory for storing your files, applications, anything. But from now on you will learn how to use RAM to create your blueprints.

## Data
You have learned how to use sources in your blueprints. They are words starting with an octothorpe ( `#` ) that represents data. Now spaces are like sources but they start with an `@` instead of `#` so a space name may looks like:<br>

```
@space	@spaceName		@spaceNumber12
```

The difference between space and source is a source is a data that your system gives you but space is a data that you enter it’s value, Now you should ask how can I add data to a space?
